NOTE: The golden triangles must have two-digit primes in them, but are allowed to have the same prime, or different primes, it really doesn't matter. As long as they're primes the fit the rules. (0 and 1 are not prime.)

Solutions need to be mapped/converted onto puzzle from the output of the file. Solution may also be adapted to solve similar Slant Prime Sudoku puzzles with a different setup (Going to add this at some point)
